                    Life long learner and adventurer, there are few career paths that I have not dabbled in.
                    I entered the work force when I was only 14 working at a family friends pizzaria. From there I 
                    moved to working in retail; I did this until I graduated in 2016. After moving and making a few life
                    choices I decided to try out the medical feild as a Certified Nursing assistant. I worked this job for a few years
                    before deciding to attend college for the first time. I attened a community college for a semester or tow
                    part time until deciding to move to Cincinnati where I began working closely in pet care such as dog daycare and boarding
                    as well as professional grooming. I was happy in the animal feild but I craved a more comfortable life and in 2021 I decided
                    to begin attending college again, first at Cincinnati State then at Northern Kentucky University, to aquire a degree in 
                    software engineering in hopes of being hired by a tech company and ultimately achieving a higher paying job equating to a more 
                    comfortable life.

                    You can say I am a bit of a nomad. I was born in Atlanta Georgia. I lived there for ten years after which my family and
                    I moved to my parents home town in the beautiful state of Michigan. I spent another ten years there spending a lot of time
                    hiking and exploring the state. Now I live in Cincinnati Ohio in hopes of finding new excitement in this next phase of my life.

                    Solving problems is what I do. During my exploration through my careers the main consistancy has always been
                    the apprecation my team mates have for my problem solving abilities. Whether it was handling a schedualing conflict
                    or fixing a simple computer problem I was often one of the first people asked to help in many of my past professions.
                    As a software engineer I enjoy using my problem solving skills to enhance and/or repair the applications that I work on.

                <p>
                    My hobbies includes digital art. I have been working on digital art since 2009. Growing up I loved to draw and I 
                    also loved computers. Digital art is the happy marrage between the two. My subjects mostly include pets and other 
                    animals including humans, but I am exploring more into painting landscapes and city scapes.
